A Python script that lets track shopping habits by: 
- writing data into Excel (using command prompt)
- display stats to the user including showing plots

Program uses openpyxl to interact  with Excel file and matplotlib to plot data.

The main purpose of the project was to learn using openpyxl, hence Excel is used to store data instead of something more practical, like a proper database.

Test suite created with Unittest framework.
